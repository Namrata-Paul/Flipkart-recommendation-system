# Flipkart-recommendation-system

The project focuses on techniques used in content-based recommendation systems in order to recommend a product based on the description of the product. For the successful completion of this project, I used the dataset of Flipkart products, which was easily available on Kaggle. It is a content-based filtering recommendation system that is able to analyze products and find similarities with the active users to recommend products.

The methods used to build the content-based recommendation system include Tf-IDF and KNN.  KNN is used to locate related items because it identifies the objects that are closest to a given target based on the Minkowski distance metric.
